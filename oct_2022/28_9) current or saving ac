/*
Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of account for its customers, one called savings account and 
the other current account. The savings account provides interest and withdrawal facilities. 
The current account provides withdrawal facility but no interest. Create a class Account that stores 
customer name, account number, type of account (Savings / Current) and balance. Include the necessary 
methods in order to achieve the following tasks:

a) SavingsAccount - Get the account holder name, account number, type of account, and accept deposit from 
a customer. Update the balance and calculate the interest for the balance amount and display the account 
holder name, account number, type of account, and updated balance.The interest provided for savings account is 2%.
b) CurrentAccount - Get the account holder name, account number, type of account, and accept withdrawal 
from a customer. Update the balance and if the balance is less than Rs. 1000, a penalty of Rs.100/- is 
debited from the account. Display the account holder name, account number, type of account, and updated 
current balance.

The initial deposit of SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount is Rs.1000/- and Rs.5000/- respectively
