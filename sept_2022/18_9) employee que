Write a program by creating an 'Employee' class having the following methods and print the final salary.
1 - 'getInfo()' which takes the salary, number of hours of work per day of employee as parameter
2 - 'AddSal()' which adds $10 to salary of the employee if it is less than $500.
3 - 'AddWork()' which adds $5 to salary of employee if the number of hours of work per day is more than 6 hours.



import java.util.*;

class rough{
    public static void main(String args[]){

        Employee e = new Employee();
        e.getInfo();
        e.addSal();        
        e.addwork();
        System.out.println(e.salary);
    }
}

class Employee{
    Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);

    int salary,hours;
    void getInfo(){
        System.out.print("enter the salary : ");
        salary = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.print("enter the number of hours : ");
        hours = sc.nextInt();
    }

    void addSal(){
        if(salary < 500){salary += 10;}
    }

    void addwork(){
        if(hours > 6){salary += 5;}
    }
}
